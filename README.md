     My mission, because I'm a superhero!
-->

### My mission
My mission is to architect and optimize solutions at the intersection of technology and business. Leveraging my expertise in the full SDLC, Agile methodologies, and deep data analysis (SQL, Predictive Modeling), I specialize in translating complex functional requirements into clear, measurable value. I drive business transformation by implementing data-backed solutions—from streamlining internal efficiency by up to 40% to defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for AI-driven features. I am focused on building solutions that are not just efficient, but strategic, human-centric, and proven by the data.
